        The world is not what it used to be. A virus has infected most of the population, turning people into zombies.
        At your destination airport there is rumored to be a vaccine.
        You must get there to survive this nightmare.
        This game uses turn-based combat. The player attacks first and then each enemy attacks the player.
        If your health during combat decreases to zero, you die. Pay attention to your statistics.
        You gain experience points for defeating enemies. With enough points you level up and your damage and health increases.
        You need fuel in order to travel to another airport. You can search for more fuel and bandages at each airport.
