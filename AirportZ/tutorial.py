# DISCLAIMER: Prologue-funktio on täynnä dialogia, joten se on funktiona huomattavasti pitempi kuin yksikään toinen
# funktio pelissä. Prologue on olemassa vain johdantona peliin uudelle pelaajalle.
# Funktiossa pelaaja voi valita vaihtoehdoista, joista useimmista ei tapahdu mitään erilaista.
# Tämä tapahtuu vain siksi, että pelaaja totuttelee käyttämään valintoja pelaamiseen, ja feikkivalinnoista
# hänelle voi syntyä kuitenkin immersio peliin.
# Tätä ns. tutoriaalia ei ole pakko pelata, vaan sen voi skippaa.
